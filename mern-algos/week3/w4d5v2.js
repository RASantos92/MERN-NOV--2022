// Construct a class called Node.
// The Node class should have two attributes data (this is where values will be stored, data can be any data type), 
// and next (this is going to represent an instance of the Node class).
// data attribute should be declared upon creation. (passed in through the constructor)
// next attribute should be default to null, (not passed in through the constructor)
// after constructing the class make three instances of Nodes, every new Node after the first that is created should be tied to the Node created before it.
